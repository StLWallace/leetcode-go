# Leetcode in GO
Disclaimer: I understand that Leetcode is contrived, and being good at it is neither sufficient nor necessary to prove software engineering skill. That being said, I'm doing these to practice GO and learn the fundamentals better. These will probably be lousy code that seems Pythonic at times (because that's what I know), but it's still fun.


# Structure
I'm putting all the sections in `/problems/{problem name}/{problem name}.go`. Sometimes I include tests here also, but not always. I'm occasionally updating `cmd/main.go` to run pieces of the problems, but it's generally unused for now.
